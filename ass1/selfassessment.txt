complete and correct programs:  50/ 50


Does your program compile without warnings? Are there any blocks of repeated code that can be simplified?
My code did compile without warnings.

good programming practices:     30/ 30

Do you have comments for each class both in the header and
implementation file? Does each variable and function have an
associated comment? Is your program properly indented? See "Code Style Examples - Snippets" under C++ Resources for some common problems. For example, all file names have to be in lowercase, all class names are capitalized, need to have spaces after comments, stick to maximum 80 characters per line, space between operators, etc.
I do have comments for both header and implementation file. I think it have a proper code style.
